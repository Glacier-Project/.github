## What is the Glacier Project?
The Glacier Project is an effort to build a usable open-source mobile computing platform. Our goal is to create:

 - An open-hardware mobile phone, that can be assembled with readily available parts and tools
 - A secure (but open) mobile operating system, including a full SDK and documentation
 - Web services (for GPS, IM, etc...) that respect the user's freedom and privacy
